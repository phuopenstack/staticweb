=======
User assigned managed identities enable Azure resources to authenticate to cloud services (e.g. Azure Key Vault) without storing credentials in code.
This type of managed identities are created as standalone Azure resources, and have their own lifecycle. A single resource (e.g. Virtual Machine) can utilize multiple user assigned managed identities.
Similarly, a single user assigned managed identity can be shared across multiple resources (e.g. Virtual Machine).
------------
A system assigned managed identity is restricted to one per resource and is tied to the lifecycle of this resource.
You can grant permissions to the managed identity by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The managed identity is authenticated with Azure AD, so you donâ€™t have to store any credentials in code
